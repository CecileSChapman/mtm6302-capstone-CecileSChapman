## Part 4

### Sources

### Challenges

Since I did most of the JavaScript during part 3, the new parts added are:

- fixed the id issue by using parseInt
- I struggled the most with getting the checkboxes to be synced, and I had to ask advice from a programmar I know to guide me with this.
    - The advice he gave was to check the value of the checkbox and to set the overlay checkbox to match it. 
    - then to do a change event listener for the overlay checkbox that changes the value of the other one.
    - this was really the only outside sourse I had to use, other than some quick google searches to remember code format (w3schools, stackoverflow);
- I had to add some inputs so I could set up the load more button without repeating more code, so I decided to change the limit number to a variable.
- part 4 also makes the details all dynamic, which was pretty straightforward to me.
