### Font

- I used Roboto for my font, as it reminds me of technology.

### Colours

- I decided to go with a dark theme, because it's easier on the eyes... for most people at least.

- I used a slighly darker red than the pokeball red to match the dark background.

- The title and button colours are white to go with the red background, whereas the pokemon name and numbers are muted shades of white to go with the dark theme.

### Caught Pokemon

- User will be able to click the circle to signify the pokemon is caught.

- the pokeball means that the pokemon is caught
